# Arch Linux Installation
---
This repository documents a minimal Arch Linux installation created to repurpose an old, unused machine and gain hands-on experience working with a personal server and custom development environment. What began as a way to host my own projects and portfolio site for free evolved into a deeper dive into real-world systems—covering topics like servers, networking, security, and self-hosting.
By using a machine like the ThinkPad T400, I avoided risking my daily computer and gained valuable insight into bootstrapping Arch Linux directly onto a bare SSD, rather than relying on the safety of virtualization.

# Installation and Practical Notes
---
In this section, I will walk you through my journey from only knowing basic linux commands like "ls" and "cd" to installing a minimal server

## The Bones
---
The first step was to find a piece of hardware to put linux on. As a broke college student, my options were...  limited. Thankfully, after digging around in my girlfriend's basement I found an old Thinkpad T400 that nobody wanted.

However, if you know anything about Thinkpads, which I did not, after a little research it is obviously clear that some upgrades are needed. On the bright side, Thinkpads stay surprisingly relevant for linux due to their upgradability, unlike the modern consumerist laptops made today. Once again though, due to my financials upgrades needed to be minimal and give me the most value per dollar spent since one wrong move will mean eating ice cubes for dinner with a side of financial regret. Taking that into account, I chose **RAM and the drive** as my core upgrades with a few others for later. Specifically, having more RAM means better multitasking which, for a webserver/live portfolio/NAS is paramount. Finally switching from a Hard Drive to an SSD not only makes things like boot time and program launching faster but actually makes the install process itself much faster.

The last physical piece to this setup realistically is the ISO file which, to my dismay, was an image of Arch Linux on a bootable media used to bootstrap linux to the SSD. At this point, you may be asking "what's wrong with that?". Well, as hard as this is to believe, I had already gone over budget so a bootable USB was out of the picture. This is where things became truly *Linux*. Instead of using USB I found some blank CD's and did some research. Turns out, CD's are basically just the analog version of USB's - and yes, you most definitely can burn ISO's onto them. Who would've thought I would be in a library burning CD's to boot a Thinkpad T400 in 2025? Talk about a blast from the past.

We have now laid down the skeleton for the server, next up is the nervous system.

## The Nerves
---
What would be the brain and extensive nervous system in the human body is, in my own absurd reality, the operating system of a computer. However, in this context, Arch Linux is more of an alien mind parasite — slowly taking control of its provided braindead host while we observe from a safe distance, studying the process. Despite the weirdly vivid imagery, I described Arch Linux in this carefully dramatic way because it is surprisingly accurate. So, keep that in mind while we go through my process.

The first step is to give our host the parasite, or in other words, put the CD in the disk drive. We boot into the BIOS and choose the disk to boot on. Then we see the Linux start up log (and I feel like I'm hacking the pentagon). All that is left now is to type "archinstall" in the terminal, press enter, and choose what software and configurations you want. Regrettably, I followed the Arch Wiki manually before learning this command existed. Ironically, that is exactly why I can now explain what linux does under the hood.

In the metaphor I talk about a "provided braindead host" which references the SSD. The SSD has nothing on it to start which is why the host would be considered braindead. Linux takes that blank canvas and creates a partitioning table that basically allows Linux to organize it in a way where it understands where everything is. In a nutshell, when you use archinstall Linux is literally formatting and cloning itself to the hardware and reporducing itself just like a virus replicates itself in host cells.

With our little makeshift Linux mind virus now in full control of this Frankenstein project, we can move on to the good stuff. It's time to give this thing some meat.

## The Meat
---
The last step to this process is one that really never truly finshes. Adding the meat to our little Frankentstein is as simple as knowing what you want and looking up software that does that for you. For this projects there are a few main things that it needs. To be a live portfolio/webserver/NAS we will need a mix of daemons (programs that persistently run in the background) and other services. Specifically I used a combination of mariadb, PHP support, Apache, OpenSSH, tailscale, ufw, NetworkManager, and some lightweight GUI and customization software.

In general, the choice of programs (or Frankenstein flavor) is going to be wildly different depending on your needs but these services fit my specific needs best. For the most part, I used mariadb, PHP, and OpenSSH quite literally just because I already had some experience with them and my a lot of my school projects rely on PHP and mariadb. But, what would be the point of having this support if you can only see them on your local machine? I mean half the reason computers are so cool is because you can access your own website from any computer.

Now, this leads me to basically the rest of my software choices. When you get this far you run into things like IP addresses and networking. Originally, I had a dynamic IP address and had configured duckdns to create my own little webserver that worked with a free subdomain. I then also realized I could access my files from anywhere using the same subdomain with ssh and so I also set that up with some quick portforwarding and ufw rules. Honestly, for me this was awesome. It finally felt like I had built a real server and something that was actually useful. 

Of course, this also begs the question "If he has all this set up why does he have tailscale?". Well you're right to ask that because tailscale literally does all of that and more. But, tailscale is overkill unless there is a good reason to use it and I wanted to learn about networking not have it be done for me. Long story short, I moved to a new apartment where they provided metronet fiber optic wifi with rent. As cheap as I am there was no way I was going to not use fiber optic internet that comes with rent no matter how frustrating it was to set up. After many calls to metronet and a landlord who refused to even converse with me about the wifi they were supposed to provide I got my own router and got my way. I am now convinced that all my neighbors probably gave up and bought wifi from different providers. Regardless, everything was going great until I realized my server just didn't work anymore because well - why would it? After some research I realized that sometimes fiber optic companies use CGNAT meaning port forwarding is useless unless you upgrade to a static IP. This is where tailscale comes in. By being cheap I inadvertently found tailscale which honestly was the best software I had ever encounterd. Not only does it do everything I just set up on my server in a mesh system but it bypassed metronet's CGNAT. A CGNAT basically just blocks all incoming connection requests but tailscale connects two devices using two outgoing requests that meet in a type of middleman completely bypassing that process.
