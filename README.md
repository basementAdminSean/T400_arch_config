# Arch Linux Installation
This repository documents a minimal Arch Linux installation created to repurpose an old, unused machine and gain hands-on experience working with a personal server and custom development environment. What began as a way to host my own projects and portfolio site for free evolved into a deeper dive into real-world systemsâ€”covering topics like servers, networking, security, and self-hosting.
By using a machine like the ThinkPad T400, I avoided risking my daily computer and gained valuable insight into bootstrapping Arch Linux directly onto a bare SSD, rather than relying on the safety of virtualization.
